### Hi, Iâ€™m William Terpstra
- :wave: I'm an aspiring data scientist passionate about machine learning and data storytelling.
- :mortar_board: I currently have 2 years of experience being a data analyst under my belt
- ðŸŒ± In addition I'm trying to increase my Python proficency so it reaches parity with my R skills
- :eyes: Check out my capstone project that uses nested-cross validation and conformal inference to compare multiple predictive models to estimate the severity and likelihood of shareholder litigation for Mohawk Industries!
- Currently working on shiny automated pdf generation with quarto for my budget & potentially spin that up into a small business self-service app for Shopify & Toast
- In my free time I enjoy reading, drawing, video game development, going on long walks in nature, and hanging out with my friends.
